# KaggleTitanic
Repository to solve the Kaggle Titatanic competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview)


## Variable Notes

*pclass*: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

*age*: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

*sibsp:* The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

*parch:* The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.


## Next Steps:

- Improve data exploration with better graphics
- Handle missing values with a KNN Inputer
- Do some feature engineering
- Prepare data for training 
- Train the Classifiers
